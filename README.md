# MODEL-FOR-PREDICTING-GARMENT-SIZE

An E-commerce company based in New York City sells clothing online.
The Company also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers
come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they
can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they
want. The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their
mobile app experience or their website.
The Project model of linear regression predicts on test data, by train test
split of 70% and 30%, this training value has given us an accuracy of 98.2 % on
training subset and 98.9 % on train subset. The dependent variable is ‘Yearly
Amount Spent’; independent variables are the rest in dataset. The prediction
alludes that the company should invest more on app as it gives more profit as
compared to other platform i.e. website.
